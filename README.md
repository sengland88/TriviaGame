# TriviaGame

i started by creating my questions and answers. I opted to create another key/value pair to hold the index of the correct answer. 

i created the for loop that iterated through the questions. 

i tied elements on my html to javascript through jquery. 

i created a function to checking the users guess against the correct answer. and then functions that would let the user know if they were right or if they were wrong. it also increase the respective variables. 

the timer passes in the time (20 seconds). if it reaches zero then it shows a transition screen and increases unanswered questions by one.

then at the end, i created a sort of restart function that displays results as well as the button to play again (with different text on it.)
